# Personal Codex Workspace

This folder stores iterative agent process improvements for this monorepo.

## Layout

- `notes/`: task-by-task learnings, pitfalls, and validated command patterns.
- `helpers/`: reusable snippets/scripts/checklists that speed up repeated work.

## Usage Rules

1. Read relevant notes before starting substantial changes.
2. Add short, high-signal notes while solving problems.
3. Promote repeated patterns from notes into helpers.
4. Keep content practical, concise, and repository-specific.
